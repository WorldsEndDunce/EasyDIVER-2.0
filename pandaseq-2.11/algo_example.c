/*
 * To create a new scoring algorithm:
 * 1. Make a copy of this file with the name of your algorithm.
 * 2. Edit `Makefile.am` and include the new file in the `libpandaseq_la_SOURCES` list.
 * 3. Edit `algo.c` and include your algorithm in the `panda_algorithm_register` list.
 * 4. Edit `pandaseq-algorithm.h` and add a new section for your algorithm and the weird 3-line definition stanza.
 * 5. Fill in this file, renaming "example" to the name of your algorithm.
 * 6. Compile and test.
 * 7. Edit `pandaseq.1` and include documentation about the parameters.
 * 8. (Optional) create a Vala class in `vapi.in`.
 *
 * Have a look at the existing algorithms to get an idea of how to write these.
